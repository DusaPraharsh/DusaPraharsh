### 🎮 What’s Playing on the Screen?

🚧 **This screen updates live!**  
Imagine it like a GameBoy boot-up:

1. **Boots up** with your name and a short intro  
2. **Scrolls to show your skills** (like a fighting game character select screen)  
3. **Then shows your socials as pixel icons**

*(You're seeing an empty screen for now — content being rendered below)*
